{"name":"Crook of Rao","type":"equipment","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the <em>Crook of Rao</em> was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse—and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact’s bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the <em>Crook of Rao</em>—potentially for the final time.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"<a title=\"Artifacts\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts\">Artifacts</a>\" section of the <em><a class=\"sourcebook\" title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2 charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Absolute Banishment.</strong></em> While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can’t return to the plane the <em>Crook of Rao</em> banished it from for 100 years.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Failing Matrix.</strong></em> Whenever the <em>Crook of Rao</em>’s Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table.

Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the <em>Crook of Rao</em>, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend’s name in Iggwilv’s voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the <em>Crook of Rao</em>. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying or Repairing the Crook.</strong></em> The <em>Crook of Rao</em> can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god’s tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything pg 123","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"artifact","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"capacity":{"type":"weight","value":0,"weightless":false},"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/400/637411376411088919.png","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/401/637411376412446403.png","filterType":"Wondrous item","isConsumable":false,"isContainer":false,"isCustomItem":false,"isHomebrew":false,"isMonkWeapon":false,"isPack":false,"levelInfusionGranted":null,"tags":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":67,"pageNumber":123,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/401/637411376412446403.png"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":2401219,"originalName":"Crook of Rao","version":"3.1.14"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"effects":[],"img":"icons/weapons/staves/staff-crescent-purple.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665420711983,"modifiedTime":1665420711983,"lastModifiedBy":"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ":3},"_id":"1A50Ck9bVl7QYXd9"}

This special action can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Dragon</th>\n<th>Resistance</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Black</td>\n<td>Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>Lightning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bronze</td>\n<td>Lightning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Copper</td>\n<td>Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gold</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td>Poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Red</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silver</td>\n<td>Cold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>White</td>\n<td>Cold</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>","chat":"","unidentified":null},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 165","quantity":1,"weight":45,"price":0,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"veryRare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":15,"type":"medium","dex":2},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"scalemail","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":true,"proficient":true,"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":null,"avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/19/221/636382364046956631.jpeg","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/188/636284728153996196.jpeg","filterType":"Armor","isConsumable":false,"isContainer":false,"isCustomItem":false,"isHomebrew":false,"isMonkWeapon":false,"isPack":false,"levelInfusionGranted":null,"tags":["Detection","Combat","Warding"],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":165,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/188/636284728153996196.jpeg"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":5380,"originalName":"Dragon Scale Mail","version":"3.1.14"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"effects":[],"img":"icons/commodities/leather/scales-blue-white.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665420710098,"modifiedTime":1665420710098,"lastModifiedBy":"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ":3},"_id":"7SpeLOlcfLvBj1np"}

Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book’s open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can’t be reduced or avoided by any means.

{"name":"Teeth of Dahlver-Nar","type":"equipment","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The Teeth of Dahlver-Nar are stories given form. They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of wildly different origins and made from various materials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Using the Teeth.</strong></em> While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).</p>\n<p>If you don’t sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).</p>\n<p>Each tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth’s result is rolled after it’s been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sowing Teeth.</strong></em> To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Implanting Teeth.</strong></em> To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can’t be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Recovering Teeth.</strong></em> Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Teeth.</strong></em> Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth’s story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.</p>\n<h5>Teeth of Dahlver-Nar</h5>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>1d20</th>\n<th>Tale and Tooth</th>\n<th>Creatures Summoned</th>\n<th>Implanted Effect</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The Staring Cats of Uldun-dar (ivory cat molar)</td>\n<td>9 cats</td>\n<td>The tooth has 8 charges.

{"name":"Hand of Vecna","type":"equipment","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn’t escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.</p>\n<p>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.</p>\n<p>Some say that Vecna’s lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King’s rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna’s tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One’s will in the world.</p>\n<p>The Eye of Vecna and the <em>Hand of Vecna</em> might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.</p>\n<p>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p>To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The Eye of Vecna and the <em>Hand of Vecna</em> each have the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 minor beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Properties of the Hand.</em></strong> Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.</li>\n<li>Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.</li>\n<li>The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: finger of death (5 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (2 charges), or teleport (3 charges). The hand regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the suggestion spell on you (save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act.

The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.</p>\n<p>Swan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot- wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees.

You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence.

No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.</p>\n<p>Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.</p>\n<p>Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn, or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can’t be divined.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Nature} can’t abide the book’s presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.</p>\n<p>A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book’s contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.</p>\n<p>Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s alignment changes to neutral evil.</p>\n<p>The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can’t be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> has the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>3 minor detrimental properties</li>\n<li>2 major detrimental properties</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Adjusted Ability Scores.</em></strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can’t adjust your ability scores again.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mark of Darkness.</em></strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Persuasion}) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Intimidation}) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Command Evil.</em></strong> While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can’t use this property again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dark Lore.</em></strong> You can reference the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dark Speech.</em></strong> While you carry the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite words from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Book.</em></strong> The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.</p>\n<p>If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.</p>\n<p>A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 × 100 years later.</p>\n<p>If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Vile Lore</strong></p>\n<p>The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> touches on every evil in the cosmos. A character can use the lore the book contains to unearth terrible secrets no mortal should know. Among the contents a character might find are the following, plus whatever else you choose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vile Apotheosis.</strong> The book could hold a ritual that allows a character to become a lich or death knight.</li>\n<li><strong>True Names.</strong> The true names of any number of fiends might be in the book.</li>\n<li><strong>Dark Magic.</strong> Several spells of horrific evil of the DM’s design and choosing could be in the book.

{"name":"Eye of Vecna","type":"equipment","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn’t escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.</p>\n<p>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.</p>\n<p>Some say that Vecna’s lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King’s rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna’s tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One’s will in the world.</p>\n<p>The <em>Eye of Vecna</em> and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.</p>\n<p>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The <em>Eye of Vecna</em> and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 minor beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Properties of the Eye.</strong></em> Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ]{truesight}.</li>\n<li>You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a ring of X-ray vision. You can end this effect as a bonus action.</li>\n<li>The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charges), crown of madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 charges), dominate monster (5 charges), or eyebite (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM’s control.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Destroying the Eye and Hand</h4>\n<p>If the <em>Eye of Vecna</em> and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas , both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna’s many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Dungeon Master's Guide pg 224","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"artifact","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"capacity":{"type":"weight","value":0,"weightless":false},"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/25122/350/637855687990993213.jpeg","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/25122/351/637855687992553066.jpeg","filterType":"Wondrous item","isConsumable":false,"isContainer":false,"isCustomItem":false,"isHomebrew":false,"isMonkWeapon":false,"isPack":false,"levelInfusionGranted":null,"tags":["Damage","Buff","Debuff","Utility","Combat","Cursed","Eyewear"],"sources":[{"sourceId":3,"pageNumber":224,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/25122/351/637855687992553066.jpeg"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":11112,"originalName":"Eye of Vecna","version":"3.1.14"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"effects":[],"img":"icons/commodities/biological/eye-lizard-green.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665420711484,"modifiedTime":1665420711484,"lastModifiedBy":"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ":3},"_id":"T3zPTKolp3ik0iUF"}

If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.</p>\n<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions.

It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it.

It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</li>\n<li>The <em>goat of travail</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>\n<li>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a <strong>lance, +1</strong>, and the other becomes a <strong>longsword, +2</strong>. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened} of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.<br /><br /></li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"rare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"capacity":{"type":"weight","value":0,"weightless":false},"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","filterType":"Wondrous item","isConsumable":false,"isContainer":false,"isCustomItem":false,"isHomebrew":false,"isMonkWeapon":false,"isPack":false,"levelInfusionGranted":null,"tags":["Summoning"],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":1}]},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":4833,"originalName":"Figurine of Wondrous Power (Ivory Goats)","version":"3.1.14"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"effects":[],"img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-grey.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665420711149,"modifiedTime":1665420711149,"lastModifiedBy":"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ":3},"_id":"WKpTByd5kjgviKHM"}

His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich’s empire in Vecna’s stead.

{"name":"Mighty Servant of Leuk-o","type":"equipment","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it—and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.</p>\n<p>Tales of the servant’s origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the <em>Machine of Lum the Mad</em>. The best details on the device’s origins and operation can be found in the <em>Mind of Metal</em>, a tome of artificer’s secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad’s several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Dangerous Attunement.</strong></em> Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.</p>\n<p>The servant’s controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.</p>\n<p>Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Controlling the Servant.</strong></em> While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster’s next turn.</p>\n<p>A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.</p>\n<p>While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)</li>\n<li>Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)</li>\n<li>As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.</li>\n<li>When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ghost in the Machine.</strong></em> Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM’s discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.</p>\n<p>If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{charmed} for 24 hours. While @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{charmed} in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact— preferably using the servant, if possible.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Self-Destruct.</strong> </em>By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant’s two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.</p>\n<p>If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.</p>\n<p>This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso— drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Servant.</strong></em> The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the <em>Machine of Lum the Mad</em>, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant’s self-destruct property.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything pg 131","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"artifact","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"capacity":{"type":"weight","value":0,"weightless":false},"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/475/637411380530821914.png","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/476/637411380535890084.png","filterType":"Wondrous item","isConsumable":false,"isContainer":false,"isCustomItem":false,"isHomebrew":false,"isMonkWeapon":false,"isPack":false,"levelInfusionGranted":null,"tags":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":67,"pageNumber":131,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/476/637411380535890084.png"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":2405333,"originalName":"Mighty Servant of Leuk-o","version":"3.1.14"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"effects":[],"img":"icons/magic/fire/flame-burning-chain.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665420711993,"modifiedTime":1665420711993,"lastModifiedBy":"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ":3},"_id":"ZlfaXLjfMZogzEb9"}

{"name":"Eye and Hand of Vecna","type":"equipment","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn’t escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.</p>\n<p>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.</p>\n<p>Some say that Vecna’s lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King’s rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna’s tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One’s will in the world.</p>\n<p>The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.</p>\n<p>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p>To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 minor beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Properties of the Eye.</strong></em> Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have truesight.</li>\n<li>You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a ring of X-ray vision. You can end this effect as a bonus action.</li>\n<li>The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charges), crown of madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 charges), dominate monster (5 charges), or eyebite (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM’s control.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Properties of the Hand.</strong></em> Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.</li>\n<li>Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.</li>\n<li>The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: finger of death (5 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (2 charges), or teleport (3 charges). The hand regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the suggestion spell on you (save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Properties of the Eye and Hand.</strong></em> If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are immune to disease and poison.</li>\n<li>Using the eye’s X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.</li>\n<li>You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can’t be surprise;surprised.</li>\n<li>If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.</li>\n<li>If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells.

Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Explosive.</strong></em> Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong></p>\n<p>All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature}, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>THIS IS UNOFFICIAL MATERIAL</strong></span></p>\n<p>These game mechanics are usable in your campaign if your DM allows them but not refined by final game design and editing.

Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapo<span class=\"No-Break\">ns remain.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A <strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">moonblade</span></strong> passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to <span class=\"No-Break\">its power.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A <strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">moonblade</span></strong> serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the e<span class=\"No-Break\">lven gods.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A <strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">moonblade</span></strong> won’t serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is <span class=\"No-Break\">destroyed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A <strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">moonblade</span></strong> has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the <strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">moonblade</span> </strong>an additional property.

{"name":"Demonomicon of Iggwilv","type":"equipment","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss’s infinite layers and inhabitants, the <em>Demonomicon of Iggwilv</em> is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book’s spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The artifact has the follow random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “<a title=\"Artifacts\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts\">Artifacts</a>” section of the <em><a class=\"sourcebook\" title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast Tasha’s hideous laughter from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: magic circle (1 charge), magic jar (3 charges), planar ally (3 charges), planar binding (2 charges), plane shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), summon fiend (3 charges; appears in this book).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Abyssal Reference.</strong></em> You can reference the <em>Demonomicon</em> whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Survival}) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fiendish Scourging.</strong></em> Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ensnarement.</strong></em> While carrying the book, whenever you cast the magic circle spell naming only fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Containment.</strong></em> The first 10 pages of the <em>Demonomicon</em> are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the <em>Demonomicon’s</em> empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature’s widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p>When you finish a long rest, if you and the <em>Demonomicon</em> are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can’t try to possess you again for 7 days.</p>\n<p>When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Demonomicon.</strong></em> To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book’s pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book’s remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, <em>Fraz-Urb’luu’s Staff</em>. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the <em>Tome of Zyx</em>, the work that served as the foundation for the <em>Demonomicon</em>. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb’luu instantly knows.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything pg 125","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"artifact","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"capacity":{"type":"weight","value":0,"weightless":false},"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/415/637411376939831778.png","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/416/637411376941228249.png","filterType":"Wondrous item","isConsumable":false,"isContainer":false,"isCustomItem":false,"isHomebrew":false,"isMonkWeapon":false,"isPack":false,"levelInfusionGranted":null,"tags":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":67,"pageNumber":125,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/416/637411376941228249.png"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":2407504,"originalName":"Demonomicon of Iggwilv","version":"3.1.14"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"effects":[],"img":"icons/sundries/books/book-eye-purple.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665420712008,"modifiedTime":1665420712008,"lastModifiedBy":"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ":3},"_id":"jKnIpFB06baXOMna"}

{"name":"Luba's Tarokka of Souls","type":"equipment","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.</p>\n<p>Created by a figure of Vistani legend, <em>Luba’s Tarokka of Souls</em> shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck’s creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarroka deck. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul— as it inevitably will.</p>\n<p>Like all tarokka decks, the <em>Tarokka of Souls</em> is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “<a title=\"Artifacts\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#ArtifactProperties\">Artifacts</a>” section of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: comprehend languages, detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, locate object, or scrying. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can’t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Enduring Vision.</strong> </em>While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Twist of Fate.</strong></em> As an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:</p>\n<p><strong>Weal.</strong> The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Woe.</strong> The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.</p>\n<p>The deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Prisoners of Fate.</strong></em> Whenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll d100 and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the <em><a title=\"Monster Manual\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm\">Monster Manual</a></em>. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.</p>\n<h5>Souls of the Tarokka</h5>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d100</th>\n<th>Card</th>\n<th>Soul</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td>Artifact</td>\n<td>Flameskull</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td>Beast</td>\n<td>Wraith</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td>Broken One</td>\n<td>Banshee</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td>Darklord</td>\n<td>Vampire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td>Donjon</td>\n<td>Mummy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n<td>Executioner</td>\n<td>Death knight</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>7</strong></td>\n<td>Ghost </td>\n<td>Ghost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>8</strong></td>\n<td>Horseman</td>\n<td>Mummy lord</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>9</strong></td>\n<td>Innocent</td>\n<td>Ghost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>10</strong></td>\n<td>Marionette </td>\n<td>Mummy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>11</strong></td>\n<td>Mists </td>\n<td>Wraith</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>12</strong></td>\n<td>Raven</td>\n<td>Vampire spawn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>13</strong></td>\n<td>Seer</td>\n<td>Vampire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>14</strong></td>\n<td>Tempter </td>\n<td>Vampire spawn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>15-00</strong></td>\n<td> —</td>\n<td>— </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div id=\"table-link\">@Compendium[world.tables-ddb.Luba's Tarokka of Souls: Souls of the Tarokka]{Open RollTable Luba's Tarokka of Souls: Souls of the Tarokka}</div>\n<p>The released soul appears at a random location within 10d10 miles of you and terrorizes the living.

This reveals a fifteenth soul, a lich, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated.

For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell’s horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.</p>\n<p>A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience—ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. “We may wander amid the shadows,” Mother Luba said. “But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.”</p>\n<p>Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the <em>Tarokka of Souls</em>. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything pg 129","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"artifact","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"capacity":{"type":"weight","value":0,"weightless":false},"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/456/637411379801123719.png","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/457/637411379803106177.png","filterType":"Wondrous item","isConsumable":false,"isContainer":false,"isCustomItem":false,"isHomebrew":false,"isMonkWeapon":false,"isPack":false,"levelInfusionGranted":null,"tags":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":67,"pageNumber":129,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/457/637411379803106177.png"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":2405238,"originalName":"Luba’s Tarokka of Souls","version":"3.1.14"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"effects":[],"img":"icons/sundries/gaming/rune-card.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665420711988,"modifiedTime":1665420711988,"lastModifiedBy":"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ":3},"_id":"kqM7wkRL4p4otm7U"}

The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can't attack.

If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.</p>\n<p>Swan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot- wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.</p>\n<p>Tree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.</p>\n<p>Whip. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place.

{"name":"Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle","type":"equipment","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: <em>Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle</em>. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts\">Artifacts</a>\" section of the <em><a class=\"sourcebook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a></em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Properties of the Mortar.</strong></em> The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding—if there's enough space—up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Properties of the Pestle.</strong></em> The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\n<p>The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Perfect Tools.</strong></em> While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>You can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Primal Parts.</strong></em> As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Traverse the Night.</strong></em> If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Bones Know Their Home.</strong></em> When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Mortar and Pestle.</strong></em> The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the <em>Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga</em> or by Baba Yaga herself.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything pg 121","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"artifact","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"capacity":{"type":"weight","value":0,"weightless":false},"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13983/710/637414606165119749.png","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13983/711/637414606166301413.png","filterType":"Wondrous item","isConsumable":false,"isContainer":false,"isCustomItem":false,"isHomebrew":false,"isMonkWeapon":false,"isPack":false,"levelInfusionGranted":null,"tags":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":67,"pageNumber":121,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13983/711/637414606166301413.png"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":2400730,"originalName":"Baba Yaga’s Mortar and Pestle","version":"3.1.14"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"effects":[],"img":"icons/tools/cooking/mortar-black.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665420711975,"modifiedTime":1665420711975,"lastModifiedBy":"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ":3},"_id":"q8Oqb43asAMOrGZ3"}

When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.</p>\n<p>Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus.

She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.</p>\n<p>To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world.

If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.</p>\n<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>\n<p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.</p>\n<p>Bronze Griffon (Rare). This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.</p>\n<p>Ebony Fly (Rare). This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a giant fly for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.</p>\n<p>Golden Lions (Rare). These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>\n<p>Ivory Goats  (Rare). These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>goat of traveling</em> can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</li>\n<li>The <em>goat of travail</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>\n<li>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a lance, +1, and the other becomes a longsword, +2. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened} of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>\n<p>Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.</p>\n<p>If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.</p>\n<p>Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ]{darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet and can see @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{invisible} creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>\n<p>Serpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.</p>\n<p>Silver Raven (Uncommon). This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the animal messenger spell on it at will.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 169","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"varies","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"capacity":{"type":"weight","value":0,"weightless":false},"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/216/636284733359233869.jpeg","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/217/636284733359592520.jpeg","filterType":"Wondrous item","isConsumable":false,"isContainer":false,"isCustomItem":false,"isHomebrew":false,"isMonkWeapon":false,"isPack":false,"levelInfusionGranted":null,"tags":["Summoning"],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":169,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/217/636284733359592520.jpeg"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":5413,"originalName":"Figurine of Wondrous Power","version":"3.1.14"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"}},"effects":[],"img":"icons/commodities/treasure/figurine-idol.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665420710147,"modifiedTime":1665420710147,"lastModifiedBy":"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ":3},"_id":"vliBrRsUlo2cqYId"}

Nothing less than a <strong>wish</strong> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruin.</strong> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>\n<p><strong>Skull.</strong> You summon an avatar of death--a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death.

{"name":"Orb of Dragonkind","type":"equipment","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five <em>Orbs of Dragonkind</em> (or <em>Dragon Orbs</em>) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>\n<p>As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>\n<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p>\n<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>\n<p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{charmed} by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>\n<p>While you are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{charmed} by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.</p>\n<h4>Random Properties</h4>\n<p>An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> has the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Spells</h4>\n<p>The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges).</p>\n<p>You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.</p>\n<h4>Call Dragons</h4>\n<p>While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.</p>\n<h4>Destroying an Orb</h4>\n<p>An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons.
