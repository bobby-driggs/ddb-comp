If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some poss<span class=\"No-Break\">ibilities.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Harpers: </span></strong>Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Investigation}, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying.

Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Religion}, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order’s ideals, and the clergy of the order’s pa<span class=\"No-Break\">tron gods.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Emerald Enclave:</strong> </span>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave.

But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{History}, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance<span class=\"No-Break\">’s ideals.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Zhentarim:</strong> </span>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people.

The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this b<span class=\"No-Break\">ackground.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Evermeet.</span></strong> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your<span class=\"No-Break\"> homeland.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture o<span class=\"No-Break\">r society.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Halruaa.</span></strong> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can w<span class=\"No-Break\">ork magic.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa’s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods<span class=\"No-Break\"> of magic.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Kara-Tur.</span></strong> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn’t your true ethnicity, because that’s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares yo<span class=\"No-Break\">ur origin.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission<span class=\"No-Break\"> was over.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Mulhorand.</span></strong> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts <span class=\"No-Break\">of Faerûn.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Those who leave behind Mulhorand’s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of <span class=\"No-Break\">your home.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sossal.</span></strong> Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed<span class=\"No-Break\"> in white.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason.

Faerûn has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities.</p> <p>Though the term “knight” conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerûn don’t restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren’t limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order’s cause.</p> <p>The “Knightly Orders of Faerûn” sidebar details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to.</p> <p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Persuasion}, plus one from among @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Arcana}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{History}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Nature}, and @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Religion}, as appropriate for your order</p> <p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set or musical instrument</p> <p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p> <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> One set of traveler’s clothes, a signet, banner or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Suggested Characteristics</strong></p> <p>Use the tables for the soldier background in the <a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\"><em>Player’s Handbook</em></a> as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order.</p> <p>Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight’s ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one’s order.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>KNIGHTLY ORDERS OF FAERÛN</strong></p> <p>Many who rightfully call themselves “knight” earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor’s Eternal Order or Mystra’s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word “knight” think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations.</p> <p><em><strong>Knights of the Unicorn.</strong></em> The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur’s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue’s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses.</p> <p><strong><em>Knights of Myth Drannor.</em></strong> Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they’ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest.</p> <p><em><strong>Knights of the Silver Chalice.</strong></em> The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe’s ethos is the nobility’s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.</p> </blockquote><p></p><h2>Knightly Regard</h2><p>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community—whether a lone settlement or a great nation—that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share those ideals.</p><p>This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight in a fight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide","advancement":[]},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"featId":27,"version":"3.1.8"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"background"}}},"img":"icons/skills/trades/academics-book-study-purple.webp","effects":[],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1664142091759,"modifiedTime":1664142091759,"lastModifiedBy":"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"aGoxb8mMNhC874cZ":3},"_id":"XLxLXBrReBJiFBUI"}

Few city-states in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civ<span class=\"No-Break\">ilization.</span> <br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Silent Rain.</span></strong> Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if i<span class=\"No-Break\">nterested.</span> <br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The Bloodaxes.</span></strong> Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold <span class=\"No-Break\">Bloodaxes.</span></p> </blockquote> <div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Hanging\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong> @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Athletics}, <span class=\"No-Break\">@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Persuasion}<br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tool Proficiencies:</span></strong> One type of gaming set, vehic<span class=\"No-Break\">les (land)<br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Equipment:</span></strong> A uniform of your company (traveler’s clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set of your choice, and a pouch containing the remainder of your last wag<span class=\"No-Break\">es (10 gp)</span></p> <div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div> <blockquote> <p class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>FEATURE: MERCENARY LIFE</strong></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can.

{"name":"Knight","type":"background","system":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Background: Knight</h1><p></p><p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p> <p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p> <p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p> <p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p> <p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p> <p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span class=\"No-Break\">you put it on).</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart — in a chaste sort of devotion.
